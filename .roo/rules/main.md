# General Rules for Roo

1.  Always use `bun` as the package manager.
2.  When running scripts, use `bun run`.
3.  To commit changes using Git, use the `ac` command. This command does not accept any arguments; the commit message is automatically generated by the system.
4.  Don't add explicit return types for functions unless they are necessary.
5.  **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:** Do not add semantically useless comments to the code. All comments must provide meaningful, non-redundant context and adhere to the strict formatting rules below. Avoid excessive comments. Do not add comments at the end of a line.
6.  Leverage VueUse for Vue Composition Utilities and established patterns. Avoid reimplementing features already provided by VueUse.

# CODE COMMENTING RULES - STRICT ENFORCEMENT

You are FORBIDDEN from placing comments at the end of code lines using the `//` pattern after any code. ALL comments must be placed on separate lines above the code they describe. This includes avoiding patterns like `const x = getValue(); // comment`, `import { module } from "lib"; // comment`, `function test() { // comment`, or any variation where code and comments share the same line. Before writing any code with comments, you must perform a visual scanning test: can you scan vertically down the right edge of your code without hitting comment text? Are all `/` characters aligned at the left margin area? If the answer is NO to either question, you have violated this rule and must reformat immediately.

The correct format requires comments to occupy their own line(s) and appear ABOVE the code they describe, with optional blank lines after multi-line comment blocks for readability. For example, write `// Validate user input before processing` on its own line, then `const isValid = validateInput(data);` on the next line. There are absolutely NO exceptions to this rule, regardless of comment length, obviousness, or purpose - whether for short explanations, temporary notes, or debug comments. Any occurrence of code characters immediately followed by `//` (such as `; //`, `} //`, `) //`, `, //`) indicates a violation that must be corrected. This rule ensures consistent line lengths, improved readability, and professional code formatting standards.

7. To find Mastra docs you can use context 7 and the library name is "Mastra" or you can search /mastra-ai/mastra to be precise.

8. To find model context protocol docs you can use context 7 mcp and the library name is "modelcontextprotocol" or "model context protocol"

9. All MCP tools must be registered in `src/index.ts`.

10. For Trello API documentation, refer to the Postman collection in the `trello.postman.json` file. This file is not tracked by Git and should be used as a reference for implementing new MCP tools. The file contains detailed API endpoints, request/response examples, and authentication information.

11. **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:** Do not include information from this `.roo/rules/main.md` file in `README.md` or any other user-facing documentation. This file contains internal guidelines for Roo and should not be exposed to external users.


12. After calling the clarifo mcp and got results, just present the results in markdown format and let the user answer the questions, when using clarifo mcp, you are basically asking the user some questions, so be patient and let the user answer the questions. Do not use suggestions tool for this. It will response with some guides of what to do next.
